## Problem Description & Requirements

Paper-Rock-Scissors (sic) is a game for two players.

Each player simultaneously opens his/her hand to display a symbol:
* Fist equals rock
* Open hand equals paper
* Showing the index and middle finger equals scissors.

The winner is determined by the following schema:
* paper beats (wraps) rock
* rock beats (blunts) scissors
* scissors beats (cuts) paper.

Write a Program that plays Paper-Scissors-Rock (sic) between the computer and a real player.

You should be able to play the game n times before the program exits.

## Todo

* Add test.cpp which shows how easy it is to test each individual part of the system
    * Shorter hands, weirder rules
    * Multiple bot/bot games

* Create a class for the Hand and keep rules together?
    * Only 1/2/3 should be possible!
