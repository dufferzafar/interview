The assignment takes approximately 5-6 hours. If you expect to run over time, please let me know.

Ready to take the assignment?

When starting the assignment, please take the following into account:

* We would like you to provide a solution as console application and as if it were for a production system. Please keep it simple (e.g., refrain from http-server based solutions and / or docker components).
* The solution needs to meet the requirements with simple, clean, understandable, and extensible code.
* Testing is important to us, so provide good test coverage.
* We like candidates to demonstrate the power of C++, (e.g., apply design patterns and use object-oriented modeling where appropriate).
* If do you decide to use frameworks or libraries, please ensure they add sufficient value and explain why you chose to use a particular framework or library in a README file.

Please see the ![attached PDF](./Assignment.pdf) for further information on the coding assignment.

If you have any questions, please, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me on this e-mail address.

We'll review your submission and come back to you in due course.
